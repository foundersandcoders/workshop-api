#Afternoon Extension Activity

Pair up and choose one of the following activities. For both you will need to read the TFL Documenation, and google if you get stuck.

###Option 1
Change the your app to be specific to your local (or preferred) station.

###Option 2 (Harder)
Using the tfl documenation, can you work out how build a journey planner between stations? The following URL may give you some guidance.
[https://api.tfl.gov.uk/journey/journeyresults/westminster/to/bank](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/journey/journeyresults/westminster/to/bank)
You will also want to look at [inputs](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp), or possibly [select tags](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp)
